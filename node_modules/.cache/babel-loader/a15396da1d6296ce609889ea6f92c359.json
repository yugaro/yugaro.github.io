I'm a bachelor of Engineering Science majoring in intelligent systems, which are synthesized by mathematics, control theory, computer hardware, and software engineering behind artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data. The unique knowledge and interdisciplinary experienced skill sets as an engineer allow me to merge multidisciplinary resources, from the theoretical developments to the applications.
